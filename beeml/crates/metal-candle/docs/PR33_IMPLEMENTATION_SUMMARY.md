# PR #33 Implementation Summary: Benchmark Infrastructure

**Date:** December 10, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Related PR:** #33 - v1.2.0: Fused Softmax Integration + Coverage Improvements

## Overview

Added comprehensive benchmark infrastructure to support both automated CI smoke tests and official release benchmarks. This addresses the need for performance validation while acknowledging the limitations of shared GitHub Actions runners.

## What Was Added

### 1. GitHub Actions Benchmark Smoke Tests

**File:** `.github/workflows/benchmark-smoke.yml`

**Purpose:** Automated benchmark smoke tests that run on every PR to catch major performance regressions.

**Features:**
- Runs on Apple Silicon (macos-14 = M1 runners)
- Low sample size (10 iterations) for speed
- Detects major regressions (>20%)
- Posts PR comment with disclaimer about accuracy
- Falls back gracefully if benchmarks don't exist

**Limitations Documented:**
- ± 10-20% timing variance due to shared hardware
- Not suitable for performance marketing claims
- Only catches major bugs, not subtle regressions

**Run Time:** ~1-2 minutes per PR

### 2. Official Benchmark Runner Script

**File:** `scripts/run_official_benchmarks.sh`

**Purpose:** Comprehensive benchmark runner for release validation and performance claims.

**Features:**
- Pre-flight environment checks (battery status, CPU usage, other processes)
- System information capture (hardware, OS, git commit)
- Multiple runs with cooldown periods (default: 5 runs, 60s cooldown)
- Results saved with timestamps
- Environment snapshot for reproducibility
- Quick mode for testing (`--quick`)
- Skip MLX option (`--no-mlx`)

**Usage:**
```bash
# Full official benchmarks (30-60 minutes)
./scripts/run_official_benchmarks.sh

# Quick test (for testing the script)
./scripts/run_official_benchmarks.sh --quick

# Skip MLX comparison
./scripts/run_official_benchmarks.sh --no-mlx
```

**Output:**
- Results directory: `benchmark_results/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`
- Individual run files: `{benchmark}_run{N}.txt`
- Environment snapshot: `environment.txt`

**Run Time:** 30-60 minutes (full), ~5 minutes (quick mode)

### 3. Benchmark CI Strategy Documentation

**File:** `docs/BENCHMARK_CI.md`

**Purpose:** Comprehensive documentation on benchmarking strategy, methodology, and best practices.

**Contents:**
- Problem statement (why GitHub Actions isn't enough)
- Hybrid approach (CI smoke tests + local official benchmarks)
- Detailed comparison of options
- Best practices for environment control
- Workflow diagrams
- FAQ addressing common questions

**Key Points:**
- CI for catching bugs (automated)
- Local for performance claims (manual, controlled)
- Clear guidance on when to use each

### 4. Release Process Documentation

**File:** `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md`

**Purpose:** Complete step-by-step release process including benchmark validation.

**Contents:**
5 phases with detailed checklists:
1. **Pre-Release Validation** (1-2 days)
   - Code quality checks
   - Integration testing
   - Dependency audit

2. **Official Benchmarks** (1 day)
   - Environment preparation checklist
   - Benchmark execution with `run_official_benchmarks.sh`
   - Results analysis
   - Documentation updates

3. **Documentation Updates** (2-3 hours)
   - CHANGELOG, version numbers, release notes

4. **Release Execution** (1 hour)
   - Tag creation, crates.io publishing, GitHub release

5. **Post-Release** (1 hour)
   - Verification and announcements

**Also Includes:**
- Emergency rollback procedure
- Release checklist template
- Tools and scripts reference
- FAQ

### 5. CONTRIBUTING.md Updates

**File:** `CONTRIBUTING.md` (updated)

**Added Section:** "Benchmarking Guidelines"

**Contents:**
- When to run benchmarks (CI vs Official)
- Running CI benchmarks
- Running official benchmarks
- Best practices for benchmark code
- Adding new benchmarks
- Performance claim guidelines
- Integration with release process

## Key Decisions & Rationale

### Decision 1: Hybrid Approach (CI + Local)

**Rationale:**
- GitHub Actions M1 runners ARE available ✅
- BUT: Shared hardware has ±10-20% variance ❌
- Solution: CI for smoke tests, local for claims

**Benefits:**
- Automated regression detection (free, every PR)
- Accurate performance validation (manual, releases)
- Clear separation of concerns
- No expensive self-hosted runners needed

### Decision 2: Documented Limitations

**Rationale:**
- Transparency about CI benchmark accuracy
- Clear expectations for contributors
- Prevents misuse of CI numbers for marketing

**Implementation:**
- PR comments warn about variance
- Documentation emphasizes limitations
- Performance claims require local validation

### Decision 3: Comprehensive Environment Control

**Rationale:**
- Performance claims require reproducibility
- Environment significantly affects timing
- Must match MLX comparison conditions

**Implementation:**
- Pre-flight checks in benchmark script
- Battery status, CPU usage monitoring
- Kill high-CPU processes option
- Cooldown periods between runs
- Environment snapshot capture

### Decision 4: Release Process Integration

**Rationale:**
- Benchmarks must be part of release, not afterthought
- Need clear checklist to ensure it happens
- Performance claims need validation trail

**Implementation:**
- Phase 2 dedicated to benchmarks
- Can't proceed to release without validation
- Results committed to git for transparency

## Usage for PR #33

For the current PR (#33 - Fused Softmax Integration):

### 1. CI Will Run Automatically
- Benchmark smoke tests will run on PR
- If they fail: investigate (likely major bug)
- If they pass: proceed with review

### 2. Before Release (v1.2.0)
```bash
# Prepare system
# Close apps, plug in power, wait for idle

# Run official benchmarks
./scripts/run_official_benchmarks.sh

# Analyze results
cd benchmark_results/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
# Review variance, calculate medians

# Update documentation
vim BENCHMARKS.md
# Add validated performance numbers

# Commit results
git add benchmark_results/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
git commit -m "docs: official benchmark results for v1.2.0"
```

### 3. Update Performance Claims

Current CHANGELOG.md claim:
```markdown
- **Fused Softmax Kernel**: Integrated custom Metal kernel (#27)
  - 3.25x speedup for softmax operations on Metal devices
```

Should become (after validation):
```markdown
- **Fused Softmax Kernel**: Integrated custom Metal kernel (#27)
  - 3.2x speedup for softmax operations (M1 Max, median of 5 runs)
  - Tested on tensor shapes [2, 128, 512] (batch, seq, features)
```

## Testing Performed

### Benchmark Smoke Test Workflow
- ✅ Verified YAML syntax
- ✅ Checked GitHub Actions compatibility
- ⚠️ Requires PR to test actual execution

### Official Benchmark Script
- ✅ Made executable (`chmod +x`)
- ✅ Help text works (`--help`)
- ⚠️ Requires actual benchmark run to validate fully

**Recommended Test:**
```bash
# Quick test of the script (won't affect benchmarks)
./scripts/run_official_benchmarks.sh --quick --no-mlx
```

## Integration with Existing Infrastructure

### GitHub Actions CI
- Complements existing `ci.yml`
- Same runner type (`macos-14`)
- Same caching strategy
- Separate job (doesn't slow down main CI)

## Answers to Original Question

> Can we do benchmark CI work on GitHub Actions with accurate results?

**Answer:** Yes and No

**Yes:**
- ✅ GitHub Actions has Apple Silicon (M1) runners
- ✅ We CAN run benchmarks automatically on every PR
- ✅ They catch major performance bugs (>20% regression)

**No:**
- ❌ Shared hardware has ±10-20% variance
- ❌ NOT suitable for "25.9x faster than MLX" claims
- ❌ Cannot detect subtle performance regressions (<10%)

**Solution:** Hybrid approach implemented
- CI: Automated smoke tests (cheap, fast, catches bugs)
- Local: Official benchmarks (expensive, slow, validates claims)

> Should we create a local testing process as part of the release process?

**Answer:** Yes - Implemented

**What We Created:**
1. `scripts/run_official_benchmarks.sh` - Automated local benchmark runner
2. `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md` - Phase 2 dedicated to benchmarks
3. Environment control checklist
4. Results capture and documentation workflow

**Benefits:**
- Validates performance claims with confidence
- Reproducible benchmark methodology
- Audit trail for performance numbers
- Integrates naturally with release process

## Conclusion

We now have a comprehensive benchmark infrastructure that:

✅ **Automates** what can be automated (CI smoke tests)  
✅ **Controls** what needs control (local official benchmarks)  
✅ **Documents** the methodology (clear strategy docs)  
✅ **Integrates** with release process (mandatory validation)  
✅ **Balances** speed vs accuracy (hybrid approach)

This infrastructure ensures that:
- Performance regressions are caught early (CI)
- Performance claims are validated (local)
- Release quality is maintained (process)
- Contributors have clear guidelines (documentation)
